# FoxBuildGameEngine
This is my Game Engine, it uses libaries like Dear Im Gui, TinyFileDialogs, etc., It is an engine inspired by the open-source 2d and 3d Game engine, Godot. 
It currently has a Node Parenting system, a heirarchy, and draggable nodes with a few node type each with their own properties, you can try it out here in 
this code, this code is currently compiled for linux, so if you run another os, i will provide the builds for it.
